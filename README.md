# JAVA Attendance System

## Introduce

Develop an attendance system where students can ask for leave on the system and view attendance records, 

and teachers can review whether to approve the student’s leave application and check the class attendance.

## Development environment
Use Eclipse JAVA, phpMySQL and Scene Builder to create a student attendance system for teachers and students to use.


The database stores courses and instructors, as well as courses that students have taken.
Students can apply for leave for their selected courses on the system.
The teacher can review the student’s application for pass or fail, and view the overall attendance of the course.
