# JAVA-attendance-system

Use JAVA, php MySQL and Scene Builder to create a student attendance system for teachers and students to use.

The database stores courses and instructors, as well as courses that students have taken.
Students can apply for leave for their selected courses on the system.
The teacher can review the studentâ€™s application for pass or fail, and view the overall attendance of the course.
